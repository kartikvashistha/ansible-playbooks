# Neovim 

Simple role to install my neovim config files across my various dev machines. It was originally part of the dotfiles role, but separated to make it more portable. This should allow other folks on the internet to install & trial my neovim configuration to better decide which parts of the config they like. 

To install this/my neovim config, please run the `playbook-nvim-dots.yml` at the root of this repo (note, please backup your exisiting neovim config, if any as this will overwrite your current neovim config).
